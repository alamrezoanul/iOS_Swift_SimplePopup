This README depicts whatever steps are necessary to get this application up and running.

### How do I get set up? ###

* 1. Clone the repo 
* 2. Install cocoapod by one of the following method you prefer most:
     * a. Follow the installation section of this page https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html
       But If you are in too hurry, then you can just copy & paste this command to your terminal: 
       $ sudo gem install cocoapods
     * b. Or, if you are a brew fan like me cause it is easier to maintain the updates of packages using brew, 
then you can just run this command to your terminal: $ brew install cocoapods

* 3. CD to the root of this project from command line, Run $ pod update 
* 4. Open AppstorePreparation.xcworkspace file in your xcode, hit run 

Voila!!
